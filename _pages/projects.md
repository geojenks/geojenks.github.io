Academic Research:

Ongoing:

[Matching the Stitch](https://cfpr.uwe.ac.uk/matching-the-stitch/): Using segmentation, diffusion, and classification models to reverse-engineer embroidered artworks according to the techniques used to fabricate them.

[An investigation of 3D technologies applied to historic textiles for improved understanding, conservation and engagement](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FX006522%2F1): I joined the project to harness state-of-the-art AI technology to interpret embroidered artwork and produce items to aid in engagement particularly for visually impaired audiences.

Finished:

[Advanced Robotics breasT ExaMination Intelligent System (ARTEMIS)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/engagement-and-simulation-science/our-work/projects/advanced-robotics-breast-examination-intelligent-system-artemis/): A large part of my PhD was centred around developing soft tactile sensors and a platform to mount them on for testing the feasibility of automated clinical breast examniations.

Other Projects:

I read about a game, crokinole, online, and saw that the boards were insanely expensive. So I gathered tongue and groove floorboard scrap wood, glued it together into a big block and jigsawed the basic circular shape and 2 sets of 12 pieces, pencilled on the boundaries and drilled out bolt holes and a central pocket. Quick enough to take with me and play on a trip in the afternoon. I'm currently drawing out dxf files to CNC route (or I guess route by hand if you're good) a set of modular boards from plywood. Will upload drawings as the project progresses.
