Hi! I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences in Oakland! I received my PhD in computer science from NYU Tandon in 2022 under my advisor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com). 
My pronouns are she/her.

At Northeastern, my areas of teaching include introductory courses (Fundamentals of Computer Science and the Align program), artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and ethical computing.
My main research interests are cybersecurity, ethics, social bias in machine learning, and teaching ethical computing. 
I strongly believe that the most efficient path to ethical tech is to have computer/data scientists who reflect the population that their products are designed to affect. 
Please feel free to reach out to me to talk about teaching, ethical computing, or online harassment! 

Outside of teaching, I am learning Spanish and Mandarin, and I love to rock climb and meditate.
