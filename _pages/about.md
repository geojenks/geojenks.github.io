Hello, I am a post doc researcher and teaching associate at the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England. I studied for my PhD under Antonia Tzemanaki and Andrew Conn as part of the [dexterous manipulation](https://www.dexterousrobotlab.com/) and [soft lab](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/soft-robotics) research groups.

My research focuses on tactile sensors and objects, with a view to enabling intelligent manipulation and creating assistive technology, particularly for visually impaired people. My academic interest stems from my belief that robotics and intelligent systems can be studied to give us an insight into what it is we are doing when we are having experiences.

I teach across subjects as part of the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology at the University of Bristol.

Alongside academia I explore nature, music, and follow any other pursuit that I find enriching.
