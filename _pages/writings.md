Another Information Translation Era

    Précis: Large Language Models and other machine learning mondels are aggregating and interpreting data for us. This is changing the way that we interact with data and sources in the most fundamental way since...

What are senses doing?

    Précis: Does understanding senses and how hey work enable us to examine the line between subjective and objective realities? A roundabout way of asking "if a tree falls in the woods, and there's nobody around to hear it, was it ever conscious?"

The 'Great Flattening' of AI

    Précis: How far can we take approximating everything with a function? AI is breaking borders with momentum - are we losing anything along the way, is it just interpolating and approximating whilst numerically rounding up and decimating by a thousand "best-fits" something beautiful, fundamental, and sublime? The reassuring elegance of mathematically rigourous theoretical physics is missing. We don't have to make do with a near-fit, waxwork simulcrum of reality in its wake.
